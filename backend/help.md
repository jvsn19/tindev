# Tindev - Backend

Backend for Tindev Application

## Database

In this project we are using [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), a free cloud mongodb database (with 500 mb storage) and [Mongodb Compass Community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass) to test our database.
For database abstraction purpose, we use [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
